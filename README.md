During July and August, LA BUVETTE organises events every Friday, featuring a special menu and live music. 
The primary purpose of the application is to provide a platform for people to book spots for these events. 
Additionally, it aids the manager in gathering and managing event-related information.

## Personal Note

This project was a real challenge for me as it was my first real client project. I learned a lot and see loads of opportunities to improve. 
Special thanks to Stefanie for trusting me with this project.
